The instructions provide clarification about the questions in the self administered organisational capacity assessment tool.  The aim is to standardize the approach used in the scoring during the assessment. Data generated from this assessment will be used to develop capacity-building plans to strengthen the organisation as well as serve the purpose of qualifying for capacity strengthening programme for biodiversity organisations.

* WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TOOL
This tool enables your organisation or grouping to assess your technical and organising strengths and influence. It is a self administered tool that will give you a comprehensive picture of the status of your organising capacity, operational resilience and sustainability. This tool will also be helpful to access funding and support from the proposed  Programme in West Africa.

* WHO CAN USE THIS TOOL
This tool can be used by civil society organisations, groups and actors. The range includes Community Based Organisations, Faith Based Organisations, Self-Help Group, Non Governmental Organisations, Coalitions, Associations, Networks, International Non Governmental Organisations, Think Tanks, Informal Groups, Professional Associations.

* HOW DO YOU USE THIS TOOL
The tool is self administered. It is recommended that it is done together as a group or a team with an elected moderator or facilitator to guide discussions and reflections. Using a focus group discussion format, participants can discuss and agree on scores for each of the statements. Justifications and evidence (where possible) should be given  for each of the agreed scores and statements.

* HOW DOES THE ASSESSMENT TOOL FUNCTION
The assessment comprises questions focusing on eight capacity areas. Each dimension has sub-sections, which speak to some key aspects. Each sub-section has a number of statements. Depending on your level of agreement with each statement, a score is selected from 1 to 5. Any option that is not applicable could be left blank in the scoring cell and NA stated in the Notes column. Please find below the interpretation of the scoring. When requested, be sure to "Enable Content" to enable the macros in this workbook to ensure its full functionality.

The 8 functional areas of this self organisational assessment tool are scored using a series of statements based on five (5) response scales:

1 - Strongly Disagree
2 - Somewhat Disagree
3 - Neutral
4 - Somewhat Agree
5 - Strongly Agree

Any textual data to qualify the response should be included in the Comments  box provided.  Identified capacity gaps should be placed in the Actions for Consideration box.This will provide important information to consider in discussing the necessary actions to take. If possible, any comments that help to identify and plan for strategic interventions should also be recorded in the Actions box.

* HOW IS THE SCORING DONE
The electronic version of the tool is set up to facilitate selecting the response and summarizing the assessment results at the end of the assessment. Each dimension has a maximum number of points that can be obtained. The combined scores of all the sub sections in a domain  are then computed in percentage terms for each domain.  These percentage domain scores are then summed and averaged to give the overall score.

* WHAT NEXT AFTER SCORING
The aggregate scores place you in a particular category depending on your scores. The four categories are Critical, Striving, Thriving and Viable. Each of these categories are defined. Accompanying the summary scores is an action plan template. This action plan template provides you with the ability to identify and document capacity gaps corresponding to each dimension, with the intention of helping you to address them independently.
